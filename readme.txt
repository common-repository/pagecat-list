Integrates a widget that displays category and page-items in one html list with support for a user-defined order.

== Description ==

Page-Cat-List is a Wordpress Plugin (surprise) that you can use for generating a sorted list (where you can/must 
define the order) with items from pages and categories. That’s the whole story. Unfortunately Wordpress does not 
implement this in its core-functionality so I had to build that on my own.

As of writing this Page-Cat-List supports:

* mix category- and page-items and display them in one list
* sort these items (first level only)
* define a title
* define a maximum depth
* define a html-id for the first ul-element
* most of the stuff you can do with get\_pages and get\_categories arguments: 
    * exclude items
    * include items
    * etc. pp.

== Installation ==

1. download Page-Cat-List here
2. extract the zip file and copy the folder to you wp-content/plugins/ folder via ftp/ftps/sftp/whatever-you’re-using-to-transfer-files-to-your-webspace
3. goto Plugins in your admin-menu and activate Page-Cat-List
4. goto Design–>Widgets and Drag’n'Drop the Page-Cat-List to one of your sidebars. Note: If you have no sidebars listed then, Google is your friend
5. enter any options (title, depth, get\_pages or get\_categories arguments, ul-id) and save your changes
6. done ;o)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to define an order? =

Just type in the page and category-ids in a comma separated list in the "Order" widget option.
The items will be displayed in the exact order you typed in from top to bottom. Remember to add
a trailing "p" to every single page id. If your page id is 42 you'll have to write down 42p.

If you're not sure about page and category ids search for a plugin or hover the links in the
listing views and look into the statusbar of your browser. The id should be part of the url.


= What am I supposed to write down in "Page Args" or "Category Args"? =

You can define excludes and stuff like that by providing args to Page-Cat-List that you would
normally hand over to [get\_pages](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_pages) or
 [get\_categories](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_categories). Just take
the syntax from there.

= Do you have some kind of example configuration? =
